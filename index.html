<p><span class="discourse">The thing that is most likely to impress you is</span> the <span class="vocabulary">sheer energy</span> of the performance. From the opening notes of 'Brianstorm' to the final encore, the band <span class="vocabulary">maintained an intensity</span> that had the entire crowd on their feet. <span class="discourse">The other feature which I found most impressive is</span> how they balanced old classics with new material. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, songs from their latest album <span class="vocabulary">fitted seamlessly alongside</span> early hits like '505' and 'When the Sun Goes Down'.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">By far the best feature was</span> Alex Turner's <span class="vocabulary">stage presence</span>. His confidence and charisma <span class="vocabulary">commanded</span> the enormous venue effortlessly. The sound quality was also <span class="vocabulary">exceptional</span> – every instrument was crystal clear despite the outdoor setting.</p>
